# Pseudo-Neuromorphic Sensor Framework

## Overview
This repository provides a lightweight framework for building **pseudo-neuromorphic sensors** on low-cost microcontrollers such as the Arduino Nano.  
The core principle is to transform standard continuous sensor readings into **event-based signals** by applying temporal windowing, spike detection, and adaptive encoding.  

Instead of transmitting raw high-frequency data streams, the framework outputs **spike-like impulses** only when relevant changes occur.  
This mimics neuromorphic sensing principles while remaining accessible and flexible for various sensor types.

## Motivation
Traditional sensor sampling approaches transmit raw data continuously, leading to high bandwidth usage and redundant information.  
Neuromorphic sensors, in contrast, emit sparse, event-driven signals that reflect *only changes in the environment*.  

This framework brings such concepts into **low-cost hobbyist hardware** by combining:
- **High-frequency polling** of commodity sensors  
- **Temporal windows** for local signal analysis  
- **Spike-based threshold detection**  
- **Data reduction** via median/mean of significant spikes  

This approach enables efficient, event-based sensing suitable for **robotics, embedded systems, and ROS integration**.

## Features
- Generic framework adaptable to various sensor modalities (distance, light, audio, etc.)  
- Window-based spike detection  
- Event-driven output with reduced bandwidth  
- Flexible thresholds and encoding strategies per sensor type  
- ROS / micro-ROS integration for robotic platforms

## Future Directions
- Support for ESP32 and micro-ROS for direct integration with ROS2 systems  
- Sensor-specific optimizations (e.g., adaptive thresholds, dynamic window sizes)  
- Benchmarks comparing event-driven vs. continuous sampling in real robotic tasks
